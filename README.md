# My Code Notes 🧠

Personal repo where I keep:
- Syntax reminders (like how a switch statement works)
- DSA practice (arrays, stacks, linked lists, etc.)
- Debugging patterns and gotchas I’ve encountered
- Code from languages I’m learning

### Why?
Because sometimes you just need to remind yourself:
> "Wait, how do I even write a for-loop in JavaScript?"

### Sections:
- `/basics`: Quick syntax and language fundamentals
- `/dsa`: My algorithm/data structure practice
- `/debugging`: Fixes, logs, and common bugs I’ve worked through
- `/snippets`: Short reusable code chunks
