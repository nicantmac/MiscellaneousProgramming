# Code Notes 🧠

Personal repo where I keep:
- Syntax reminders (like how a switch statement works)
- DSA practice (arrays, stacks, linked lists, etc.)
- Debugging patterns and gotchas I’ve encountered
- Code from languages I’m learning

### Sections:
- `basics`: Quick syntax and language fundamentals
- `dsa`: My algorithm/data structure practice
- `debugging`: Fixes, logs, and common bugs I’ve worked through
- `snippets`: Short reusable code chunks

### Just genuinely trying to keep up
