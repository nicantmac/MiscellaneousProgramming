# tuples_methods.py
# Common tuple methods (there are only 2!)

my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2)

# count(x) → number of occurrences of x
count_2 = my_tuple.count(2)
print("Count of 2:", count_2)

# index(x) → index of first occurrence of x
index_3 = my_tuple.index(3)
print("Index of 3:", index_3)

# Summary:
# - Tuples have only two methods:
#   1️⃣ count(x)
#   2️⃣ index(x)
