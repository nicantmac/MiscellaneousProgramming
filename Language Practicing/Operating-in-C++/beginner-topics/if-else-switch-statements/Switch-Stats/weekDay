// Here we are going to work on Switch Statements

/******
*
* Let's write a Switch statement that does the following:
*
* 1. Remember switch statements in C++, the cases can only register ints and not strings.
*
* 2. Make a switch statement that takes input from user (1-7) to choose a day of the week.
*
* 3. Corresponding to the number chosen, print a statement accurate to the day i.e. "Thank God it's Friday".
*
