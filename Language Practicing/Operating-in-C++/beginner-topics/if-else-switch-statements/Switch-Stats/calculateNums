// Here we are going to work on Switch Statements

/******
*
* Let's write a Switch statement that does the following:
*
* 1. Remember switch statements in C++, the cases can only register ints and not strings.
*
* 2. Make a switch statement that takes input from user to enter two numbers firstNum and secondNum respectively.
*
* 3. Then have the user type an operator to calculate the numbers.
*

int main() {

    int firstNum, secondNum;
    cout << "Enter first number: ";
    cin >> firstNum;

    cout << "Enter second number: ";
    cin >> secondNum;

    char eval;
    cout << "Enter operator (+, -, *, /, %): ";
    cin >> eval;

    switch (eval) {
        case'+':
