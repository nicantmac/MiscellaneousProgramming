// Here we are going to work on Switch Statements

/******
*
* Let's write a Switch statement that does the following:
*
* 1. Remember switch statements in C++, the cases can only register ints and not strings.
*
* 2. Make a switch statement that is set up like a grading system that ranks (A-F).
*
* 3. Take user's input and have them enter their grade(s).
*
* 4. Use integer division (score / 10) to determine the grade category.
*
