'''
PROMPT: Write a function cast_vote() that records a vote for a candidate in an election.
The function accepts:
- votes: a dictionary mapping candidate names to their current vote counts
- candidate: a string representing the candidate receiving a vote

If the candidate exists, increment their vote count by 1.
If the candidate does not exist, add them to the dictionary with 1 vote.

Expected Output:
votes = {"Alice": 5, "Bob": 3}
cast_vote(votes, "Alice") -> {"Alice": 6, "Bob": 3}
cast_vote(votes, "Gina")  -> {"Alice": 6, "Bob": 3, "Gina": 1}
