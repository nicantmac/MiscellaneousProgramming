Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server side, while Express.js is a web application framework 
built on top of Node.js to simplify and add structure to server-side development. They are complementary tools and are typically used
together, rather than being alternatives. 

Core Differences

Aspect 	Node.js	Express.js
Purpose	A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside a browser. |	A minimalist framework for building web applications and APIs using Node.js.
Functionality	Provides low-level features like the core HTTP module, file system access, and network operations. |	Adds higher-level features like robust routing, middleware support, and template engine integration.
Code Complexity	Requires more manual setup and extensive code for common web tasks like routing and handling HTTP requests.	| Abstracts much of the complexity, requiring less boilerplate code for the same functionality.
Flexibility/Control	Offers full control over the server environment and low-level details. |	Provides a structured approach, which streamlines development but adds a layer of abstraction.
Performance	Delivers raw speed for basic operations.	| Introduces a slight performance overhead due to its abstraction and middleware but improves overall application efficiency.

When to Use Which
The decision isn't usually about choosing one over the other, but rather understanding when each is the primary focus of your code. 

Use Node.js alone for:
Building specific, minimalistic servers or microservices without external dependencies.
Applications that require high CPU performance or real-time, data-intensive tasks like chat applications or online gaming.
Gaining maximum control over the server-side logic and low-level operations. 

Use Express.js (on Node.js) for: 
Building typical web applications and RESTful APIs quickly and efficiently.
Projects where a structured approach, simplified routing, and easy integration of third-party middleware (like for authentication or logging) are beneficial.
Accelerating development and reducing the amount of repetitive, manual coding. 

In short, Node.js provides the engine, while Express.js provides the steering system and structure, making the journey of building web applications smoother. Most modern back-end projects leverage the power of both working in tandem.
