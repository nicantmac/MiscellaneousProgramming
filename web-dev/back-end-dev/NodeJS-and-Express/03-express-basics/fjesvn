In Express.js, JSON is typically handled in two ways: parsing incoming JSON request bodies using express.json() middleware, and sending a JSON response to the client using res.json(). 
1. Parsing Incoming JSON Requests
To read data sent from a client in JSON format (e.g., in a POST or PUT request), you need to use the built-in express.json() middleware. This makes the parsed data available in req.body. 
Example:
javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

// Use built-in middleware to parse JSON bodies
app.use(express.json());

// A POST route to handle incoming JSON data
app.post('/profile', (req, res) => {
  // Access the parsed JSON data from req.body
  const name = req.body.name;
  const email = req.body.email;

  console.log(`Received data for user: ${name}, ${email}`);

  // Send a JSON response back to the client
  res.json({
    message: "Data received successfully",
    userData: { name, email }
  });
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
Client-side JSON payload for the above example:
json
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane.doe@example.com"
}
2. Sending JSON Responses
To send a JSON object back to the client, you use the res.json() method. This method automatically sets the Content-Type header to application/json and converts the provided JavaScript object into a JSON string. 
Example:
javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

// A GET route that sends a JSON response
app.get('/data', (req, res) => {
  const userData = {
    id: 101,
    username: "testuser",
    status: "active"
  };

  // Send the JavaScript object as a JSON response
  res.status(200).json(userData);
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
