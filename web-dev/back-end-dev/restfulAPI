REST (Representational State Transfer) is a widely adopted architectural style for designing networked applications that use standard HTTP requests to communicate between a client and a server. JavaScript, particularly with the Node.js runtime and frameworks like Express.js, is ideally suited for building and consuming these APIs. 
Core Concepts of RESTful APIs
REST APIs function using the standard HTTP request-response cycle and are built around several key principles: 
Resources: Everything is treated as a resource, identified by a unique Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), typically a URL (e.g., /api/users).
HTTP Methods: Standard HTTP verbs correspond to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations:
GET: Retrieves data from a specified resource. It should only read data and not modify the server state.
POST: Sends data to the server to create a new resource.
PUT: Updates an existing resource with the complete new data representation.
DELETE: Removes a specified resource.
Statelessness: Each request from a client must contain all necessary information for the server to understand and process it. The server does not store any client session data between requests.
Data Format: Data is typically exchanged in the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format because it is language-agnostic and easy for both humans and machines to read. 
Building REST APIs with JavaScript (Node.js and Express) 
JavaScript is excellent for building the server-side of a REST API due to its event-driven, non-blocking architecture, which handles many concurrent requests efficiently. The most common approach uses Node.js and the Express.js framework. 
A basic server setup using Express looks like this (in a server.js file): 
javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json()); // Middleware to parse JSON bodies

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));

// Example GET endpoint
app.get('/api/items', (req, res) => {
    // In a real application, you would fetch data from a database
    res.status(200).json({ message: 'List of items' }); 
});
This sets up a basic server and defines a GET route. 
Consuming REST APIs in JavaScript 
On the client side (e.g., in a web browser), JavaScript uses built-in APIs or libraries to make HTTP requests: 
The fetch() API: This modern browser API provides a simple, promise-based interface for making asynchronous requests.
javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
Axios: A popular, third-party library for making HTTP requests that works in both the browser and Node.js. It offers a cleaner API and built-in features like automatic JSON transformation and request/response interception. 
Both methods allow JavaScript applications to interact with RESTful services, making it a cornerstone technology for modern web development.
