# 😁React State Patterns

This folder contains examples and patterns for managing `state in React`. Helpful reference while building real applications.

- In React, `state` represents any data that changes over time and causes the UI to re-render.
- The examples here will show `how state behsaves`, `how it flows`, and `how it interacts with user actions and async logic`.
