# useEffect
```useEffect``` is a fundamental React Hook that allows you to perform certain actions in function components after initial render from browser

<br/>To use `useEffect()` in your React applications, **start with** importing useEffect from React library.
```
import { useEffect } from 'react';
```

## How it works?
```
export default function App() {
   useEffect(() => {
     // side effect logic
   }, [dependencies]);
}
```

Fetching data
Subscribing to events
Updating the DOM
Running logic when state or props change

What is useEffect?

useEffect runs after a component renders.
It lets your component react to changes in state, props, or lifecycle events.

There are only 3 valid patterns you will ever use in real React apps - 1️⃣ No dependency array, 2️⃣ Empty dependency array [], 3️⃣ Dependency array with values, 🔁 Multiple dependencies

explain runs once when the component mounts, Runs whenever a specific value changes, Demonstrates fetching data from an API, Shows how to clean up side effects like timers or subscriptions.
---
Examples:

Fetching data

Logging something

Setting up timers

Subscribing / unsubscribing

Syncing state with props or URL

🧠 Key Concepts
Concept	Meaning
Dependency Array	Controls when effect runs
Cleanup Function	Runs before unmount or re-run
Empty Array []	Runs once
No Array	Runs every render
---
✅ When to Use useEffect

Use it for:

Fetching data

Timers / intervals

Event listeners

Syncing with external systems

Do not use it for:

Simple derived state

Basic calculations

Rendering logic

---
useEffect is for side effects, not rendering logic.

If something can be derived directly from props or state — don’t put it in an effect.

---
🔍 Summary Table
Dependency Array	Runs When
None	Every render
[]	Once (on mount)
[value]	When value changes
[a, b]	When a or b changes
---
🧠 Mental Model (Memorize This)

useEffect runs after render,
and reruns when anything in the dependency array changes.
