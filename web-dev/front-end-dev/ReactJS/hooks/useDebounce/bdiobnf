useDebounce is a custom React hook that delays updating a value until a specified time has passed since 
the last change, preventing rapid, unnecessary re-renders or expensive operations (like API calls) from 
happening on every keystroke or event, thereby boosting application performance. It works by setting a 
timer; if the input value changes before the timer finishes, the old timer is cleared, and a new one starts, 
only updating the state (the debounced value) once the user pauses for the set duration. 


How it works (Simplified)
Input: A component receives a value (e.g., from a search input) and a delay time.
useEffect Setup: Inside useDebounce, a useEffect hook sets a setTimeout to update the debounced state after the delay.
Timer Management:
If the input value changes before the delay ends, the useEffect's cleanup function clears the previous setTimeout.
A new setTimeout is then set for the new value.
Output: The hook returns the debouncedValue, which only updates after the specified pause, making it ideal for search bars or auto-save features.

Common Use Cases
Search Inputs: Triggering search API calls only after the user stops typing.
Auto-Save: Saving form data after a pause in typing.
Window Resizing/Scrolling: Handling expensive calculations for resize or scroll events.

Key Benefit
Performance: Reduces load on servers and the UI by batching updates, preventing function overload from rapid events.
