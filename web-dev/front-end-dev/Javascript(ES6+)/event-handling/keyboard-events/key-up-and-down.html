keypress:
This event is deprecated and should generally be avoided in modern web development. 
It only fired when a key that produced a character value was pressed. For example, pressing 'a' would 
trigger keypress, but pressing 'Alt' would not. For capturing typed characters, the input event on input 
fields is a more suitable and recommended alternative.
