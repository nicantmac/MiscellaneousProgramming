# 🧩 API Practice with JavaScript and React

This repository contains my practice projects for working with APIs using both **Vanilla JavaScript** and **React**.  
I'm exploring how to fetch, display, and manage data from APIs in different frontend environments.

## 🧠 What I'm Practicing

- `fetch()` and `async/await`
- Error handling in API calls
- Pagination (loading partial data)
- Chained/sequential requests
- Displaying API data in the DOM (Vanilla)
- React state and effects with `useEffect`
- Clean and readable API code patterns

## 🌐 Sample APIs Used To Practice

- [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
- [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) (future)
