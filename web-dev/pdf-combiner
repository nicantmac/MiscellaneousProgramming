Yes, you can absolutely code a PDF combiner using various programming languages like Python, JavaScript, C#, or Ruby, leveraging specialized libraries such as PyPDF2, iText, PDF-Lib, or Spire.PDF to read, append, and write PDF pages into a new, merged file, making it a common and achievable coding project. 
Popular Languages & Libraries
Python: Very popular for PDF manipulation, using libraries like PyPDF2, pypdf, or pdfrw.
JavaScript: Use pdf-lib for browser-based or Node.js solutions to handle PDFs dynamically.
C#/VB.NET: Libraries like iTextSharp, Spire.PDF, or IronPDF are available.
Ruby: The CombinePDF gem simplifies merging. 
General Steps to Code a Combiner
Choose a Library: Select a PDF manipulation library for your chosen language.
Input Files: Get the paths to the PDF files you want to combine.
Initialize Merger: Create an instance of the library's merger object (e.g., PdfMerger in Python).
Append PDFs: Loop through your input files and append each one to the merger object.
Write Output: Save the merged content to a new PDF file. 
Example (Python with PyPDF2)
python
from PyPDF2 import PdfMerger
from glob import glob
import os

def merge_pdfs(folder_path, output_filename):
    merger = PdfMerger()
    # Find all PDFs in the specified folder
    all_pdfs = glob(os.path.join(folder_path, '*.pdf'))
    for pdf in all_pdfs:
        merger.append(pdf) # Append each PDF
    with open(output_filename, "wb") as output_file:
        merger.write(output_file) # Write the merged PDF

# Example usage:
# merge_pdfs('path/to/your/pdfs', 'combined_document.pdf')
This code snippet uses PyPDF2 to combine all PDFs in a folder into one.
