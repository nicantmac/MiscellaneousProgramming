# Strings
Understand strings from ```creation``` -> ```DSA level patterns```.

Strings appear simple, but they are one of the most common data structures
used in technical interviews due to their combination of:
- array-like behavior
- immutability
- pattern-based logic (windows, pointers, stacks)

## 🧱 What is a String?

A string is a ```sequence of characters```.

In most languages (Python, JavaScript, Java):
- Strings are **immutable**
- Operations like concatenation create new strings
- Many DSA string problems rely on array-based thinking

## ⏱️ Typical Time Complexity

| Operation | Typical Cost |
|---------|--------------|
| Index access | O(1) |
| Full scan | O(n) |
| Sorting string | O(n log n) |
| Sliding window | O(n) |
