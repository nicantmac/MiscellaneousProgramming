# Foundations of Data Structures & Algorithms 📚

### Overview
Personal notes with examples and explanations, and practice problems organized by topic, for learning and reinforcing core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts. Repo is like a reference library to review, practice, and build an intuition for both technical interviews and academic understanding.

### Topics Covered

- 📏 **Asymptotic Notations** (Big O, Big Theta, Big Omega)
- ⏳ **Time Complexity** analysis
- 🗂 **Arrays** and array manipulation techniques
- 🔢 **Sorting Algorithms** (Counting Sort, others)
- 🔍 **Searching Algorithms** (Binary Search, Fibonacci-related recursion)
- 🧮 **Pointer Logic** and pointer-based programming concepts
- 🔤 **String Manipulation** (Reversing, Palindromes, etc.)

## Notes

- This is an evolving resource — content is added and refined over time.
- Code is kept intentionally simple and readable for learning purposes.
- Focus is on **understanding the patterns**, not memorizing code.
