# Foundations of Data Structures & Algorithms 📚

### Overview

This repo contains my personal notes and examples, and practice problems for learning and reinforcing core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts.

It is structured as a collection of folders organized by topic — each containing relevant code snippets and explanations.

This is a **learning-in-progress** repo that I use to review, practice, and build intuition for both technical interviews and academic understanding.

### Topics Covered

- 📏 **Asymptotic Notations** (Big O, Big Theta, Big Omega)
- ⏳ **Time Complexity** analysis
- 🗂 **Arrays** and array manipulation techniques
- 🔢 **Sorting Algorithms** (Counting Sort, others)
- 🔍 **Searching Algorithms** (Binary Search, Fibonacci-related recursion)
- 🧮 **Pointer Logic** and pointer-based programming concepts
- 🔤 **String Manipulation** (Reversing, Palindromes, etc.)


## Folder Structure

| Folder Name              | Description                            |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| arrays                   | Basic and advanced array operations    |
| asymptotic-notations     | Big O / Big Theta / Big Omega notation |
| pointer-logic            | Understanding pointers & memory        |
| searching                | Searching algorithms and techniques    |
| sorting                  | Sorting algorithms and implementations |
| strings                  | String manipulation techniques         |
| time-complexity          | Time complexity examples and notes     |


## Purpose

✅ Build a solid foundation in **DSA fundamentals**  
✅ Prepare for **coding interviews**  
✅ Improve understanding of **algorithmic efficiency**  
✅ Maintain a personal **reference library** of clean example code  


## Notes

- This is an evolving resource — content is added and refined over time.
- Code is kept intentionally simple and readable for learning purposes.
- Focus is on **understanding the patterns**, not memorizing code.
